# Caliditas
Proof-of-concept wireless thermometer and humidity sensor, made for a friend of mine.

The app uses bluetooth instead of radio waves. This is because my friend needed something to show off at the UF-convention a few days later. It was the first app I ever created and I only had a few days to get it all working, so naturally the code is a bit messy.

You can find the arduino code here: https://gist.github.com/Frewacom/03887dbca5d33ade12d8c5247357bb69
