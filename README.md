# Caliditas
Arduino code: https://bitbucket.org/snippets/Frewacom/qegkXn/caliditasarduino

This app was made for a friend of mine as a proof-of-concept. Due to time constraints they asked me to make it for them so that they would be able to show something at the UF-convention. The original idea uses radiowaves for long-distance communication, not bluetooth. 

This was my first attempt at creating an app and it would only be used once, so naturally the code is a bit messy.
